This software is provided as-is. It is designed to run on The Australian Supercomputer run by NCI, GADI. Sorry if save file paths are incorrect or if any issues in reproducing these scripts on your own system. As with most science, this analysis has been highly agile and the files produced by analysis in files 1-6 may not necessiarily be used in the generation of plots in 7a,7b and 8.

Scripts should generally be run in order to run the Key notebooks: 7a,7b CH4 / Appendix and 8 for Chapter 5 Figures and Tables.
